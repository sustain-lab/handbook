## Safety

### COVID-19

Before arriving to the lab for the first time, please read the following documents that 
outline the safety procedures related to COVID-19:

* [Univerisity of Miami Standard Operating Procedure Faculty Guide](docs/um-research-sop.pptx)
* [SUSTAIN Standard Operating Procedure for Research Ramp-up](docs/sustain-sop-20200522.pdf)

Ensure to follow these procedures while on campus.

### General

* Watch your step. Floors can be wet and/or have hardware or tools on them.
* Ascend and descend the catwalk stairs always facing forward and with both hands on the rails.
* Clean up after yourself.
* Return tools after use.
* Don't leave power cables or pressure tubes laying on the ground floor, especially if connected and powered.
* Secure any cables, wires, or pressure tubing:
  - Use cable guides if possible.
  - If the cable crosses a walkway, secure it with zip-ties and mark it with tape.
* In areas that are busy with cables and/or pressure tubes such as top of SUSTAIN,
pay special attention to not step on them.
* Check that all tank panels are closed and secured (with bolts for SUSTAIN or clamps for ASIST) 
before running any wind generator
* Don't leave the lab front door propped open.

## Operations

Before conducting an experiment in either the ASIST or the SUSTAIN tank,
fill out the [Experiment design sheet](docs/sustain-experiment-design-sheet.pdf)
and share it with the group at
[sustainlabcaf@miamiedu.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:sustainlabcaf@miamiedu.onmicrosoft.com).

### SUSTAIN wind-wave tank

#### Running the wind generator

* If the wind generator is to be run at fan speeds higher than 15 Hz,
send an email to [sustainops@listserv.miami.edu](mailto:sustainops@listserv.miami.edu)
with the following information:
  - Date and time when the fan will run
  - Fresh or seawater
  - Is spray expected or not
* Further, if you anticipate generating seawater spray, use the orange cones
(located at the bottom floor of the staircase in the rear of SUSTAIN)
to divert traffic into the garage and away from the back of the SUSTAIN outlet.

Here's an example email:

```
To: sustainops@listserv.miami.edu
Subject: Saltwater spray and high wind today from 3 to 5 pm

We'll run the SUSTAIN wind fan today from 3 to 5 pm.

Salt water. There will be spray.

We'll divert vehicle traffic through the MTLSS garage starting from 3:30pm.
```

To send and email to this list, your email needs to be on the list of allowed senders.
Please email Darren O'Neal at [doneal@rsmas.miami.edu](mailto:doneal@rsmas.miami.edu)
and CC Brian Haus or Milan Curcic to request getting on the SUSTAIN Operations email list.
