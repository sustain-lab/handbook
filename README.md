## Safety

* Clean up after yourself
* Return tools after use
* Don't leave power cables laying on the ground floor, especially if connected and powered
* Secure any cables or wires:
  - Use cable guides if possible
  - If the cable crosses a walkway, secure it with zipties and mark it with tape
* In areas that are busy with cables and/or pressure tubes such as top of SUSTAIN, watch your step
* Check that all tank panels are closed and secured before running any wind generator
* Don't leave front door propped open

## Operations

### SUSTAIN wind-wave tank

#### Running the wind generator

* If the wind generator is to be run at fan speeds higher than 15 Hz, send an email to sustainops@listserv.miami.edu with the following information:
  - Date and time when the fan will run
  - Fresh or seawater
  - Is spray expected or not
* Further, if you anticipate generating seawater spray, use the orange cones (located at the bottom floor of the staircase in the rear of SUSTAIN) to divert traffic into the garage and away from the back of the SUSTAIN outlet

#### Running the wave generator

### ASIST wind-wave tank

#### Running the wind generator

#### Running the wave generator
